# webface_recognition
just install python-3.6.6-amd64
and run app.pyc from command prompt:
"python app.pyc"

The script will install required packages and last run automatically.

if you want to change the port just run with port:
"python app.pyc 5002"
#Sample 
open link with the port in web browser.
http://localhost:port/form/


Thanks.
